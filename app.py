            - **Exercise regularly:** Engage in moderate-intensity aerobic activity at least 150 minutes per week.  
            - **Quit smoking:** Smoking increases your risk of stroke; quitting lowers it.  
            - **Limit alcohol consumption:** Excessive alcohol intake can raise blood pressure and increase stroke risk.  
            - **Manage diabetes:** Keep blood sugar levels under control through diet, exercise, and medication.  
            - **Treat atrial fibrillation:** If you have atrial fibrillation, follow your doctor's advice to manage and treat it.  
            - **Manage cholesterol levels:** Maintain healthy cholesterol levels through diet, exercise, and medication if necessary.
